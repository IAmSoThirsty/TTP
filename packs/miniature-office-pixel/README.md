## Tips for Best Results

1. **Maintain pixel-perfect alignment** - Position objects on whole pixel coordinates
2. **Disable texture filtering** - Use nearest-neighbor sampling
3. **Consistent scaling** - Keep all objects at the same pixel-per-unit ratio
4. **Lighting** - Use flat or simple lighting to preserve pixel art style
5. **Camera** - Use orthographic projection for best results
