# TTP Infrastructure as Code

This directory contains Terraform modules for deploying the TTP application infrastructure on AWS.

## Architecture

The infrastructure includes:
- VPC with public/private subnets across 3 AZs
- EKS cluster for Kubernetes workloads
- RDS PostgreSQL 16 with Multi-AZ
- ElastiCache Redis cluster
- S3 buckets for texture assets
- CloudFront CDN for asset delivery
- Application Load Balancer
- Route53 DNS management
- IAM roles and policies
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.6.0
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- kubectl for Kubernetes management
- Sufficient AWS account limits for resources

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform

```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform init
```

### Plan Changes

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

### Apply Infrastructure

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

### Destroy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

## Environments

### Development
- Smaller instance types
- Single-AZ database
- Reduced redundancy
- Lower costs

### Staging
- Production-like configuration
- Multi-AZ for testing
- Full monitoring enabled

### Production
- High availability across 3 AZs
- Multi-AZ database with read replicas
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Auto-scaling enabled
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Security

- All databases in private subnets
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Security groups with minimal access
- VPC Flow Logs enabled
- GuardDuty for threat detection

## Monitoring

- CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging
- CloudWatch Metrics for infrastructure metrics
- CloudWatch Alarms for critical events
- X-Ray for distributed tracing
- Container Insights for EKS

## Cost Optimization

- Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Enable S3 Intelligent Tiering
- Use RDS Reserved Instances for production
- Enable auto-scaling to match demand
- Set up cost allocation tags

## Disaster Recovery

- RDS automated backups (35-day retention)
- S3 versioning and lifecycle policies
- Multi-region replication option
- Infrastructure as Code for quick rebuild
- Documented recovery procedures
